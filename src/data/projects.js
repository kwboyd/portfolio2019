        "description": "This was a project I built for fun to experiment with React and testing it using React Testing Library. This app allows you to breed ASCII cats to create new ones. New cats inherit the genes of their parents (which can be dominant or recessive), and each genotype has its own phenotype that determines the eyes, whiskers, and nose characters of the cat. There's also an element of randomness to each cat, which was fun a challenge for unit and integration testing.",

From day one, I fully participated in ideation and UX design, so I learned quite a bit about the process of taking an app from conception to production. Sideline's mobile app was later acquired by a larger gaming company.",

        "description": "This was a project built to help intermediate to advanced Japanese learners better study vocabulary. I built both the back-end RESTful API using Laravel for storing vocab words and the front=end quizzing app using Vue.js. This project taught me how to structure an API to best integrate it with a front-end application. I also learned best practices for writing documentation for an API and stretched my design skills to make this the most usable flashcard app for the needs of my niche audience.",
