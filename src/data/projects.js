        "description": "I joined Sideline as the company’s first hire and the sole front end developer. In collaboration with the backend developer and the UX designer, I built this app from scratch. From day one, I fully participated in ideation and UX design, so I learned quite a bit about the process of taking an app from conception to production. Sideline's mobile app was later acquired by a larger gaming company.",

During that semester, our team of developers, designers, reporters, and videographers traveled to Cuba and created this interactive documentary site. I assisted with development throughout the entire site, but the photo galleries, interactive sliders, the Queens of Cuban Music interactive, the About page, and the blackout effect on desktop videos are primarily my code. I also assisted with setting up our custom CMS using Google Drive and Node.js and handled source control of the large team using Git.",

        "description": "This was a project built to help intermediate to advanced Japanese learners better study vocabulary. I built both the back-end RESTful API using Laravel for storing vocab words and the front=end quizzing app using Vue.js. This project taught me how to structure an API to best integrate it with a front-end application, as well as the considerations necessary to accomodate multilanguage text. I also learned best practices for writing documentation for an API and stretched my design skills to make this the most usable flashcard app for the needs of my niche audience.",
